# Python constructs
# i. Functions
# A function in Python is a collection of statements grouped under a name. 
# You can use it whenever you want to execute all those statements at a time. 
# You can call it wherever you want and as many times as you want in a program. A function may return a value.

#ii. Classes
# Python is an object-oriented language. 
# It supports classes and objects. 
# A class is an abstract data type. In other words, it is a blueprint for an object of a certain kind. It holds no values. 
# An object is a real-world entity and an instance of a class.

# iii. Modules
# A Python module is a collection of related classes and functions. 
# We have modules for mathematical calculations, string manipulations, web programming, and many more. 

# iv. Packages
# Python package is a collection of related modules. You can either import a package or create your own.

# Python Frameworks

# i. Django
# Python Django is a free and open-source framework written in Python and is the most common framework for Python. 
# It allows you to create database-driven websites. It follows the DRY Principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself). 
# This is a design philosophy that keeps code simple and eloquent. 
# Popular websites like Instagram, Mozilla, and Disqus make use of it.

# ii. Flask
# Like Django, Flask is a web framework written in Python itself. 
# It is a micro framework because it does not need certain libraries and tools. 
# It also does not have form validation or a database abstraction layer. However, you can make use of extensions to add extra features.

# iii. Pyramid
# Pyramid is another web framework. 
# It is neither a mega-framework that would make decisions for you nor a micro-framework that wouldn’t force decisions. 
# It gives you optimal liberty of your project.

# iv. Tornado
# Another open-source web framework, Tornado is written in Python Language. 
# It is noted for its excellent performance and scalability.

# v. Bottle
# Like Flask, it is a micro-framework for Python. 
# It is used for web development. Bottle is known for its speed, simplicity, and lightweight. 
# A single file can run both Python 2.5+ and 3.x.

# vi. web2py
# Written in Python, web2py is another open source web framework. 
# It emphasizes on rapid development and follows an MVC architecture. MVC stands for Model View Controller.

# vii. NumPy
# NumPy is an open-source framework for Python. We use it for scientific computing. 
# It supports large multidimensional arrays and matrices, and functions to operate on them.

# viii. SciPy
# SciPy is a Python library that you can use for scientific computing. 
# It has modules for linear algebra, interpolation, fast Fourier transform(FFT), image processing, and many more. 
# It uses multidimensional arrays from the NumPy module.

# ix. Pylons
# This is a deprecated framework, which means it is no longer recommended. 
# It is a web framework and is open source as well. It makes extensive use of third-party tools.

# 7. Flavors of Python
